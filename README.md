# Dead Drop Service

**Send One-Time Secrets in a secure way**

A Dead Drop service written in Kotlin / KTor.

This service uses [sjcl](https://github.com/bitwiseshiftleft/sjcl) on client-side to encrypt the data, stores the
encrypted data on the server (while never sharing the password with the server), and generates a link to get the data
(once) again.

This is the source-code of [drop.moetz.dev](https://drop.moetz.dev).

## Setup using Docker

The docker image can be found here: [hub.docker.com/r/flowmo7/dead-drop](https://hub.docker.com/r/flowmo7/dead-drop).

Possible environment variables:

* `DOMAIN`: the domain this application is available at, e.g. `drop.example.org`
* `IS_HTTPS`: Whether this application is available as HTTPS / behind an HTTPS reverse proxy (which it should be),
  e.g. `true`
* `DATA_DIRECTORY`: The directory to store the data in (within the docker image), e.g. `/var/dead-drop/data`
* `ENCRYPTION_KEY_PATH`: The file-path to store the _server-side_ encryption key at (within the docker image),
  e.g. `/var/dead-drop/key/key.secret`
* `FILE_KEEP_TIME_IN_HOURS`: The number of hours to keep a drop-record. Defaults to 24.

## Example docker-compose.yml

```yaml
services:
  dead-drop:
    image: "flowmo7/dead-drop:master"
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - 8080:8080 #Should be behind an SSL reverse proxy
    environment:
      - DOMAIN=drop.example.org
      - IS_HTTPS=true
      - DATA_DIRECTORY=/var/dead-drop/data
      - ENCRYPTION_KEY_PATH=/var/dead-drop/key/key.secret
    volumes:
      - /srv/docker/dead-drop/data:/var/dead-drop/data:rw
      - /srv/docker/dead-drop/key:/var/dead-drop/key:rw
```

This project is heavily inspired by [BillKeenan/dead-drop-python](https://github.com/BillKeenan/dead-drop-python), which
I heavily used (self-hosted) before creating this service.
