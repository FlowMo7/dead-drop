# Dead Drop Service

**Send One-Time Secrets in a secure way**

A Dead Drop service written in Kotlin / KTor.

This service uses [sjcl](https://github.com/bitwiseshiftleft/sjcl) on client-side to encrypt the data, stores the
encrypted data on the server (while never sharing the password with the server), and generates a link to get the data
(once) again.

This is the source-code of [drop.moetz.dev](https://drop.moetz.dev).

## Setup

The docker image can be found here: [hub.docker.com/r/flowmo7/dead-drop](https://hub.docker.com/r/flowmo7/dead-drop).

Possible environment variables:

* `PORT`: The port the server listens on. Defaults to `8080`.
* `DOMAIN`: The domain this application is available at, e.g. `drop.example.org`.
* `IS_HTTPS`: Whether this application is available as HTTPS / behind an HTTPS reverse proxy (which it should be). Default to `true`.
* `PATH_PREFIX`: When the application is available on a sub-path of the given domain (routed by a reverse proxy, e.g.), the path needs to be set here. Defaults to no path.
* `FILE_KEEP_TIME_IN_HOURS`: The number of hours to keep a drop-record. Defaults to `24`.
* `SHOW_GITHUB_LINK_IN_FOOTER`: Whether the GitHub link should be visible in the footer. Defaults to `true`.
* `COLOR_CODE`: The hex-color-code the page should be styled in. Only colors on which white text is readable are supported yet. Without the leading '#'. Defaults to `ff9800`.
* `SITE_TITLE`: The title of the site. Defaults to `Dead-Drop: Send secure information`.
* `SITE_TITLE_SHORT`: The title of the site in short. Defaults to `Dead-Drop`.

### Data persistence

If you want to persist the encrypted storage, and map it out of the docker container, the following mounting points are available:

* `/var/dead-drop/data`: Is the directory that contains the encrypted data (for at most 24 hours)
* `/var/dead-drop/key/key.secret`: Is the file that contains the key for the server-side encryption (the data stored in 
the data directory is encrypted another time before persisted in the given path).

### Example docker-compose.yml

```yaml
services:
  dead-drop:
    image: "flowmo7/dead-drop:master"
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - 8080:8080 #Should be behind an SSL reverse proxy
    environment:
      - DOMAIN=drop.example.org
    volumes:
      - /srv/docker/dead-drop/data:/var/dead-drop/data:rw
      - /srv/docker/dead-drop/key:/var/dead-drop/key:rw
```

I used (self-hosted) before creating this service.
